I have image stored on url http://picsum.photos/300/300?ref=1
I want to change it's hue to 90 degree.
I want to increase it's saturation to 1.1 times.
I want to out put image to folder named "output" in my project.
Also save the original image to the same folder.
Ask user to enter a number between 0 and 1.
If the number is 0, show the original image
If the number is 1, show the output image
